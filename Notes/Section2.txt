Section 2 : Introduction to HTML

Inventor of World Wide Web/Internet and HTML - Sir Tim Bernes Lee

HTML - Defines content and structure of a website.
HTML - Hyper text markup language. 
- ‘Hyper Text’ means these are hyper links to other pages within them.
- ‘Markup’ means here we use Tags to represent various sections within the web page. Like this part is a header or this part is a link or this is an image etc.

HTML Heading Elements 
What is a ’Tag’ vs ‘Element’?
Ex : <h1>Hello World</h1> 
- <h1> is the opening head tag.
- </h1> is the closing head tag
- The entire thing including the tag + content is called ‘HTML heading Element’

- There are head tags from <h1> to <h6> in decreasing hierarchy. 


HTML Paragraph Element
Example of paragraph element : 
<p>This is a paragraph1</p>
<p>This is a paragraph2</p>
This adds a single blank line between the 2 Paragraph elements. 

Else without it, it will show as below in browser :
This is a paragraph1 This is a paragraph2

Self Closing Tags /Void Elements
1. <br /> : Break Element (adds a line break)
2. <hr /> : Horizontal rule Element (adds a horizontal line in-between like this ——————— )
These are tags that are forbidden from having any content within them and these are self closing.
