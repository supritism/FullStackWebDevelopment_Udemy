Section 4 : Multi-page Websites

File Paths
- Using file path we can direct our computer to look inside a specific location inside our hard drive. A file path can direct one to either a file or a folder.
    - Absolute path : File path that is relative to the root of a computer. 
    - Relative path : File path that is relative to something like relative to the location from where we are writing our code. These are shorter and are always valid as they are relative to the code file or directory from where we are writing.

Special Characters for Relative file paths 
1.  ../  (Two double dots) - This means to go up a level (or directory) from the current directory.
2.  ./   (Single dot) - This means to look for a file or folder in the current directory.

Web Pages (multi-page websites)
The structure can be like this : 

Webpages (Main project directory)
    - assets (directory to store all asset files needed for website pages)
        - images
            - cat.png
            - sana.png
    - public (directory that stores html web pages for various linking pages from my main website homepage)
        - about.html
        - contact.html
    - index.html (website’s home page’s html code)

QQ : How to add a clickable image which when we click goes to a specific webpage? 
<a href="./public/about.html"><img src="./assets/images/sana.png" height=200 alt="Author's clickable image" /></a>

The HTML Boilerplate
Helps understand structure of HTML. We start off with this when we create any new HTML file.
In any .html file type ! and hit Enter to have the HTML boilerplate pre-populated.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang=“en”>
    <head>
        <meta charset=“UTF-8”>
        <title>My Website</title> (This content will be shown in the Browser’s tab title)
    </head>

    <body>
        <h1> Here all your HTML content and tags will go </h1>
    </body>
</html>
